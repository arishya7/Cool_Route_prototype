💧 Water Body Cooling Effects Summary
Key Findings:
Cooling Distance:
0-50m: Maximum effect (2-6°C reduction)
50-100m: Strong effect (1.5-3°C reduction) ⭐ Best for cycling
100-150m: Moderate effect (0.5-1.5°C)
150m+: Minimal/negligible
Temperature Reductions:
Large water bodies (reservoirs, bays): 3-6°C
Medium water bodies (canals, ponds): 1.5-3°C
Small ponds: 0.5-1°C (can worsen heat at night!)
Singapore-Specific:
High humidity reduces evaporative cooling effectiveness
Effect is ~0.5-1°C less than in drier climates
BUT still valuable for marginal comfort improvement
Size Matters:
Large (>1 km²): Significant cooling, wider range
Small (<0.1 km²): Can trap heat - filter these out!
🎯 My Recommendation for V5

# Simple implementation:
WEIGHT_WATER = 0.55        # 45% cost reduction
WATER_BUFFER = 100         # meters (optimal cycling comfort zone)

# Filter: Only use water bodies > 0.1 km² (100,000 m²)
Why 0.55?
Sits between trees (0.6) and buildings (0.7)
Reflects moderate cooling: less consistent than tree shade, but more reliable than time-dependent building shadows
Conservative estimate accounting for Singapore's humidity
Comparison with existing weights:
PCN: 0.5 (50% discount) - most cooling
Water: 0.55 (45% discount) - NEW
Trees: 0.6 (40% discount)
Buildings: 0.7 (30% discount)
Combined: 0.4 (60% discount) - maximum
Should we proceed with integrating water bodies into V5 using these parameters?
